# Christ Fire Healing Ministry — Activities Manager

This is a simple single-file web app to manage ministry activities locally in your browser (no server required).

How to use
- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use "Open File" in the browser).
- Add activities using the form on the left: title, date/time, type, and optional description.
- Use the search and filter controls to find activities.
- Edit or delete items using the action buttons.
- Export your activities as JSON with the "Export" button. Import a JSON file using the file input.

Data is stored in your browser's `localStorage` under the key `cfhm_activities_v1`.

Founder: Prophet Micheal Narh

Location: Ghana — Greater Accra — Achimota Mile 7 (Abotre Junction)

If you'd like, I can extend this with user accounts, server sync, or attendance tracking.
